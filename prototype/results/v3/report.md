## Detailed Breakdown

### Engineering Leadership Experience

**Weight:** 25%

**Definition:** 10+ years of engineering experience with 3+ years in engineering leadership roles, specifically managing managers and multiple teams. Must have proven track record of building and scaling high-performing engineering teams in a SaaS or tech environment. Experience leading 2+ engineering teams simultaneously with responsibility for hiring, onboarding, and professional development.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.2 | 0.5 | 1 | 0.21 |
| Impact | 3 | 7 | 15 | 0.21 |
| Frequency | 2 | 3 | 6 | 0.21 |

**Computed Risk:** 45.09 (weighted: 11.27)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'Managed and scaled global engineering teams across India and LATAM, direct management of senior engineers and team leads, and indirect management through designated managers' and 'As Manager of the front-end team, I led day-to-day development' - Shows leadership experience but lacks clear evidence of managing multiple teams simultaneously or 3+ years in formal leadership roles
- **Impact:** Quote: 'Managed and scaled global engineering teams across India and LATAM' - Shows some leadership experience but unclear scope and duration of managing managers and multiple teams simultaneously
- **Frequency:** Quote: Leadership roles mentioned at ATTUNE (CTO), Tesorio (Director), FloQast (Head of DevOps), and M-GO (Engineering Manager) - Shows leadership across multiple roles but frequency of managing multiple teams simultaneously is unclear

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Probability:** Quantify the number of teams managed simultaneously, specify the duration of leadership roles, and detail the size of teams managed to clearly demonstrate meeting the 3+ years requirement
- **Impact:** Add specific metrics about team sizes, number of direct/indirect reports, and concrete examples of building and scaling high-performing teams in SaaS environments
- **Frequency:** Clarify which roles involved managing multiple teams simultaneously and provide consistent evidence of this responsibility across different positions

### Technical Architecture Expertise

**Weight:** 20%

**Definition:** Deep technical expertise in either backend system design or frontend component architecture. Must be a hands-on technical leader capable of driving technical excellence and making architectural decisions. Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field (or equivalent experience).

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.5 | 0.14 |
| Impact | 1 | 3 | 7 | 0.14 |
| Frequency | 0.5 | 1 | 2 | 0.14 |

**Computed Risk:** 2.19 (weighted: 0.44)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'Led a full rebuild of the core product, modernizing architecture, security model, PostgreSQL data layer, and cloud infrastructure' and 'Principal Software Architect' role - Strong evidence of hands-on technical leadership and architectural decisions
- **Impact:** Quote: 'Designed and implemented the core PostgreSQL architecture' and 'architected and managed the development of all infrastructure across several AWS accounts' - Demonstrates deep technical expertise in backend systems
- **Frequency:** Quote: Technical architecture work evident across ATTUNE (CTO), Tesorio (infrastructure migration), FloQast (Principal Software Architect), and founding engineer roles - Consistent theme throughout career

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Probability:** Add more specific technical details about system design decisions, scalability challenges solved, and architectural patterns implemented
- **Impact:** Include specific examples of complex architectural decisions made, their business impact, and technical trade-offs considered
- **Frequency:** Maintain the strong technical focus while adding more quantitative measures of architectural impact and complexity

Must demonstrate capability to drive velocity of feature development while maintaining quality, reliability, and performance. Experience fostering culture of accountability, continuous improvement, and innovation.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.2 | 0.5 | 1 | 0.21 |
| Impact | 3 | 7 | 15 | 0.21 |
| Frequency | 2 | 3 | 6 | 0.21 |

**Computed Risk:** 45.09 (weighted: 8.12)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'conducting regular 1:1s focused on mentorship and career growth' and 'I've mentored more than 60 individuals' - Shows mentoring capability but limited evidence of managing multiple engineering teams for execution and velocity
- **Impact:** Quote: 'establishing engineering standards, delivery processes, and operational rigor' - Shows some process establishment but lacks specific evidence of driving velocity while maintaining quality across multiple teams
- **Frequency:** Quote: Management and mentoring mentioned across several roles but specific evidence of managing multiple teams for execution is limited to recent positions

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Probability:** Add specific examples of driving feature development velocity, maintaining quality metrics, and managing multiple teams simultaneously with measurable outcomes
- **Impact:** Include metrics on team performance improvements, delivery velocity increases, and specific examples of balancing speed with quality
- **Frequency:** Provide consistent examples across roles of team management focused on execution, velocity, and quality outcomes

---

### Operational & Incident Management

**Weight:** 15%

**Definition:** Strong operational skills with ability to drive incidents to resolution and implement process improvements. Must balance operational urgency in handling incidents with long-term technical strategy. Experience maintaining system reliability and performance in high-velocity environments.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.2 | 0.5 | 1 | 0.21 |
| Impact | 3 | 7 | 15 | 0.21 |
| Frequency | 2 | 3 | 6 | 0.21 |

**Computed Risk:** 45.09 (weighted: 6.76)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'Defined and documented core engineering processes, including incident response, postmortems, and change management' - Shows process establishment but limited evidence of hands-on incident resolution
- **Impact:** Quote: 'improving operational consistency and reliability' and 'ensuring scalability, reliability, and operational excellence' - Shows operational focus but lacks specific incident management examples
- **Frequency:** Quote: Operational responsibilities mentioned at ATTUNE, Tesorio, and FloQast but specific incident management experience is not consistently detailed across roles

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

- **Probability:** Add specific examples of major incidents handled, resolution times, and process improvements implemented as a result of incident learnings
- **Impact:** Include concrete examples of system reliability improvements, incident response leadership, and operational metrics achieved
- **Frequency:** Demonstrate operational and incident management experience consistently across different roles with specific examples and outcomes

## Criteria Weighting Rationale

Weights prioritize the core leadership requirements (25% for leadership experience) and technical expertise (20%) as these are repeatedly emphasized and listed first in qualifications. Team management and execution (18%) and operational skills (15%) are weighted highly as they're central to the role's day-to-day responsibilities. Team motivation (12%) and collaboration (10%) receive moderate weights as important but supporting capabilities.
