## Detailed Breakdown

### Trust & Communication

**Weight:** 25%

**Definition:** You can have hard conversations with them. They say what they think. They do what they say. You'd be comfortable giving them access to the bank account.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.5 | 1 | 3 | 0.35 |
| Impact | 1 | 15 | 40 | 0.21 |
| Frequency | 3 | 6 | 10 | 0.35 |

**Computed Risk:** 830.99 (weighted: 207.75)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'I am looking for a co-founder that works well with my style - open feedback, helpful, productive, open-minded' - shows they value open communication but doesn't demonstrate their own communication style or trustworthiness in practice
- **Impact:** Trust and communication are fundamental to any cofounder relationship, especially when giving someone access to bank accounts and making critical business decisions together
- **Frequency:** No direct evidence found - profile lacks examples of difficult conversations, transparency in communication, or situations demonstrating trustworthiness across their career

---

### Shared Vision

**Weight:** 25%

**Definition:** They get that Reckn is a decision engine, not a point solution. Excited about the problem. Aligned on what kind of company you want to build and how you want to build it.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.5 | 1 | 6 | 0.28 |
| Impact | 3 | 15 | 40 | 0.14 |
| Frequency | 2 | 3 | 6 | 0.28 |

**Computed Risk:** 569.41 (weighted: 142.35)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'I'd love to hear your idea on AI- decision making engine' - shows interest in the concept but doesn't demonstrate deep understanding of Reckn as a decision engine vs point solution
- **Impact:** Shared vision is critical for cofounders to make aligned decisions about product direction, company culture, and strategic choices over the long term
- **Frequency:** Quote: 'Powered by AI & machine learning that prioritizes tasks based on value' and 'analytics platform that showed strengths and weaknesses of features' - shows some experience with decision-support systems but limited evidence of consistent vision alignment across roles

---

### Can Sell

**Weight:** 20%

**Definition:** Capable of GTM. Experience level is secondary. Comfortable talking to strangers, pitching, handling objections, and asking for money.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 1 | 3 | 6 | 0.35 |
| Impact | 7 | 15 | 40 | 0.14 |
| Frequency | 3 | 6 | 10 | 0.35 |

**Computed Risk:** 1567.66 (weighted: 313.53)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'I found a knack in helping small businesses create a more comprehensive business plan' and 'Helped small businesses improve their strategy' - shows some client-facing experience but no direct evidence of selling, pitching, or asking for money
- **Impact:** GTM capability is essential for a cofounder, especially in early-stage startups where revenue generation and customer acquisition are critical for survival
- **Frequency:** Quote: 'helping small businesses create a more comprehensive business plan' - shows some business development experience but lacks consistent evidence of sales activities across their product management roles

---

### Figures Things Out

**Weight:** 15%

**Definition:** Scrappy > credentialed. Will learn what they don't know. Doesn't wait to be told what to do. Has solved hard problems before.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.5 | 0.21 |
| Impact | 1 | 7 | 15 | 0.14 |
| Frequency | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0.21 |

**Computed Risk:** 10.55 (weighted: 1.58)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'I've worn a lot of hats including: industry research, strategy, building processes, product fit & MVP, guiding design and eng' and 'Launched Wound Care app which physicians used connected devices to photograph wounds' - demonstrates versatility and ability to tackle complex problems across different domains
- **Impact:** Problem-solving ability is crucial for startup success, but can potentially be developed if other foundational skills are strong
- **Frequency:** Quote: 'went from accounting to tax/business planning to product management' and multiple product launches across different industries - shows consistent pattern of learning new domains and solving complex problems

---

### Full-Time Committed

**Weight:** 10%

**Definition:** Binary. In or out. No other startup, no consulting on the side. Available now and willing to work for equity.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.2 | 1 | 3 | 0.35 |
| Impact | 15 | 40 | 100 | 0.07 |
| Frequency | 6 | 10 | 10 | 0.28 |

**Computed Risk:** 1747.88 (weighted: 174.79)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'I'm non-technical, passively looking' and currently employed at Comcast - 'passively looking' suggests not fully committed, and no mention of willingness to leave current role or work for equity only
- **Impact:** Full-time commitment is explicitly stated as 'Binary. In or out' - this is a fundamental requirement that cannot be compromised for a cofounder relationship
- **Frequency:** No direct evidence found - profile shows consistent employment at large corporations but no evidence of startup commitment, equity-only compensation, or leaving stable roles for entrepreneurial ventures

---

### Startup Experience

**Weight:** 5%

**Definition:** Nice to have. Not predictive. Has worked at an early-stage company or started something before.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 6 | 10 | 10 | 0.21 |
| Impact | 1 | 3 | 7 | 0.14 |
| Frequency | 6 | 10 | 10 | 0.21 |

**Computed Risk:** 541.34 (weighted: 27.07)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** No direct evidence found - all employment history shows large corporations (Comcast, Walmart, Northwestern Mutual, UHS, Penn Mutual) with no mention of early-stage companies or founding experience
- **Impact:** Criterion is explicitly described as 'Nice to have. Not predictive' - while helpful, lack of startup experience is not a deal-breaker if other criteria are met
- **Frequency:** No direct evidence found - entire career appears to be at established corporations with no startup or early-stage company experience mentioned

## Criteria Weighting Rationale

Trust & Communication is foundation - everything else fails without it. Shared Vision at equal weight because they need to understand Reckn is a decision engine, not a point solution. Sales capability matters but experience level is secondary. Scrappy beats credentials. Commitment is binary. Startup experience is nice but not predictive.
