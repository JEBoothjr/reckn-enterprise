I'd love to hear your idea on AI- decision making engine. I am looking for a co-founder that works well with my style - open feedback, helpful, productive, open-minded.

For reference I've had a few roles that roughly went from accounting to tax/business planning to product management. I've worn a lot of hats including: industry research, strategy, building processes, product fit & MVP, guiding design and eng to build that, then iterating. 

My background of finance help me really understand what the numbers should look like, my time in tax taught me about planning, and my time in product taught me how to build great products people love. I read you need some business help so maybe we would be a good fit.

YC Profile
I'm non-technical, passively looking, and have some ideas, but I'm also open to exploring other ideas.

I'm willing to do Product and Operations.

Intro
Intro
Hello! I grew up an hour from Syracuse and now live in Philadelphia. I went to college for accounting and after a few years as an auditor, I realized that it wasn't right for me. I spent some time doing taxes and found a knack in helping small businesses create a more comprehensive business plan on the side. I have now switched into product management and could be happier making digital products for others!

Progression is happiness :)
