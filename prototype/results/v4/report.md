## Criteria Weighting Rationale

Weights prioritize the core leadership requirements (25% for leadership experience) and technical expertise (20%) as these are repeatedly emphasized and listed first in qualifications. Team management and execution (18%) and operational skills (15%) are weighted highly as they're central to the role's day-to-day responsibilities. Team motivation (12%) and collaboration (10%) receive moderate weights as important but supporting capabilities.
