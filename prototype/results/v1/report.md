## Detailed Breakdown

### Engineering Leadership Experience

**Weight:** 25%

**Definition:** 10+ years of engineering experience with 3+ years in engineering leadership roles, specifically managing managers and multiple teams. Must have proven track record of building and scaling high-performing engineering teams in a SaaS or tech environment. Experience leading 2+ engineering teams simultaneously with responsibility for hiring, onboarding, and professional development.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.5 | 0.21 |
| Impact | 1 | 3 | 7 | 0.28 |
| Frequency | 2 | 2 | 3 | 0.21 |

**Computed Risk:** 5.69 (weighted: 1.42)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'Managed and scaled global engineering teams across India and LATAM, direct management of senior engineers and team leads, and indirect management through designated managers' and 'Led fully remote Infrastructure, Platform, and Integrations teams' and 'As Manager of the front-end team, I led day-to-day development' - Shows clear leadership experience with multiple teams and managing managers, with 25+ years total experience
- **Impact:** Quote: 'Operated across multiple teams simultaneously, aligning priorities, resolving cross-team dependencies' - Shows multi-team leadership but lacks specific details about team sizes, hiring numbers, or detailed scaling metrics that would demonstrate the full scope required
- **Frequency:** Quote: Multiple roles show leadership - CTO at ATTUNE, Director at Tesorio, Head of DevOps at FloQast, Engineering Manager at M-GO - Consistent leadership roles across multiple positions over several years

---

### Technical Architecture Expertise

**Weight:** 20%

**Definition:** Deep technical expertise in either backend system design or frontend component architecture. Must be a hands-on technical leader capable of driving technical excellence and making architectural decisions. Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related field (or equivalent experience).

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.2 | 0.07 |
| Impact | 1 | 1 | 3 | 0.14 |
| Frequency | 0.5 | 1 | 1 | 0.07 |

**Computed Risk:** 0.22 (weighted: 0.04)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'Led a full rebuild of the core product, modernizing architecture, security model, PostgreSQL data layer, and cloud infrastructure' and 'Principal Software Architect' and 'architected and managed the development of all infrastructure across several AWS accounts' - Extensive hands-on technical architecture experience clearly demonstrated
- **Impact:** Quote: 'Acted as the primary technical authority across architecture, security, DevOps, and data' and 'Bachelor of Science - BS, Computer Software Engineering' - Strong technical expertise with formal education, though degree completion is listed as 2026
- **Frequency:** Quote: Architecture work spans entire career - 'Principal Software Architect', 'architected a platform', 'led teams in the architecture and development', 'I architected and managed the development of all infrastructure' - Core theme across all recent experience

---

### Team Management & Execution

**Weight:** 18%

**Definition:** Ability to lead, mentor, and manage multiple engineering teams while ensuring high morale, strong execution, and technical excellence. Must demonstrate capability to drive velocity of feature development while maintaining quality, reliability, and performance. Experience fostering culture of accountability, continuous improvement, and innovation.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.2 | 0.5 | 1 | 0.21 |
| Impact | 3 | 7 | 15 | 0.28 |
| Frequency | 2 | 2 | 3 | 0.21 |

**Computed Risk:** 26.83 (weighted: 4.83)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'establishing engineering standards, delivery processes, and operational rigor' and 'conducting regular 1:1s focused on mentorship and career growth' and 'mentored junior developers' - Shows team management and mentorship but lacks specific metrics on velocity, quality improvements, or detailed execution outcomes
- **Impact:** Quote: 'I've outlined the career path strategy for DevOps Engineers' and 'promoted a manager from within the team' - Shows some team development but limited specific evidence of driving velocity while maintaining quality or detailed execution metrics
- **Frequency:** Quote: Team management appears in multiple roles - 'scaled global engineering teams', 'Led fully remote Infrastructure, Platform, and Integrations teams', 'As Manager of the front-end team' - Demonstrated across several positions

---

### Operational & Incident Management

**Weight:** 15%

**Definition:** Strong operational skills with ability to drive incidents to resolution and implement process improvements. Must balance operational urgency in handling incidents with long-term technical strategy. Experience maintaining system reliability and performance in high-velocity environments.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.5 | 1 | 3 | 0.28 |
| Impact | 7 | 15 | 40 | 0.35 |
| Frequency | 3 | 6 | 6 | 0.28 |

**Computed Risk:** 608.66 (weighted: 91.30)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'Defined and documented core engineering processes, including incident response, postmortems, and change management' and 'Owned end-to-end DevOps strategy, including AWS infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, environment isolation, and production reliability' - Shows process definition but limited evidence of hands-on incident resolution experience
- **Impact:** Quote: 'incident response, postmortems, and change management, improving operational consistency and reliability' - Shows process improvement but lacks specific examples of driving incidents to resolution or balancing operational urgency with long-term strategy
- **Frequency:** Quote: 'incident response, postmortems' mentioned at Tesorio and operational focus in DevOps roles - Limited mentions of direct incident management across the career, mostly process-focused

---

### High-Velocity Team Motivation

**Weight:** 12%

**Definition:** Demonstrated ability to motivate teams in high-velocity, high-expectation environments. Must excel at driving progress on both large-scale projects and small tasks that keep teams moving. Ability to keep teams motivated when standards and expectations are high, with experience in fast-paced, hyper-growth environments.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |

| Frequency | 6 | 10 | 10 | 0.35 |

**Computed Risk:** 7354.61 (weighted: 882.55)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'high-velocity environments' not explicitly mentioned, though 'hyper-growth environments' and startup experience at FloQast as 'employee #1' and multiple startups suggest some high-velocity experience, but lacks specific evidence of motivating teams in high-expectation environments
- **Impact:** No direct evidence found of specific experience motivating teams in high-velocity, high-expectation environments or keeping teams motivated under high standards. Startup experience suggests some exposure but lacks explicit evidence
- **Frequency:** No direct evidence found of consistently demonstrating high-velocity team motivation across roles. While startup experience exists, specific high-velocity team motivation is not explicitly described

## Criteria Weighting Rationale

Weights prioritize the core leadership requirements (25% for leadership experience) and technical expertise (20%) as these are repeatedly emphasized and listed first in qualifications. Team management and execution (18%) and operational skills (15%) are weighted highly as they're central to the role's day-to-day responsibilities. Team motivation (12%) and collaboration (10%) receive moderate weights as important but supporting capabilities.
