## Detailed Breakdown

### Trust & Communication

**Weight:** 25%

**Definition:** You can have hard conversations with them. They say what they think. They do what they say. You'd be comfortable giving them access to the bank account.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.5 | 1 | 3 | 0.35 |
| Impact | 15 | 40 | 100 | 0.21 |
| Frequency | 2 | 3 | 6 | 0.28 |

**Computed Risk:** 1046.58 (weighted: 261.64)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'Communication' and 'Interpersonal Skills' and 'Oral Communication' appear repeatedly across roles - Shows communication skills in professional contexts, but no evidence of hard conversations, directness, or reliability in high-stakes situations
- **Impact:** No direct evidence found - Trust and communication are fundamental to cofounder relationships, especially around financial decisions and difficult conversations
- **Frequency:** Quote: 'Communication' and 'Interpersonal Skills' appear across multiple roles at Greenlight, Boston Scientific, Kaplan - Professional communication demonstrated but unclear if extends to cofounder-level directness and reliability

---

### Shared Vision

**Weight:** 25%

**Definition:** They get that Reckn is a decision engine, not a point solution. Excited about the problem. Aligned on what kind of company you want to build and how you want to build it.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 3 | 6 | 10 | 0.42 |
| Impact | 7 | 15 | 40 | 0.21 |
| Frequency | 6 | 10 | 10 | 0.35 |

**Computed Risk:** 3742.50 (weighted: 935.63)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'I want a co-founder who is set on a specific idea' - Shows preference for joining existing ideas rather than building shared vision. No evidence of understanding Reckn as decision engine or excitement about the specific problem
- **Impact:** No direct evidence found - Shared vision is critical for cofounders but can potentially be developed through alignment conversations
- **Frequency:** No direct evidence found - Profile shows no history of building shared vision or working on decision engine concepts across career

### Can Sell

**Weight:** 20%

**Definition:** Capable of GTM. Experience level is secondary. Comfortable talking to strangers, pitching, handling objections, and asking for money.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 3 | 6 | 10 | 0.35 |
| Impact | 15 | 40 | 100 | 0.14 |
| Frequency | 6 | 10 | 10 | 0.28 |

**Computed Risk:** 7453.29 (weighted: 1490.66)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'Strategic partner to VPs of performance and brand marketing' and 'Partner Relationship Management' - Shows ability to work with stakeholders but no evidence of direct selling, pitching, or asking for money
- **Impact:** No direct evidence found - Sales capability is critical for startup success and GTM execution
- **Frequency:** Quote: 'Partner Relationship Management' appears in multiple roles - Shows stakeholder management but no pattern of direct sales or revenue generation activities

### Figures Things Out

**Weight:** 15%

**Definition:** Scrappy > credentialed. Will learn what they don't know. Doesn't wait to be told what to do. Has solved hard problems before.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 0.2 | 0.5 | 1 | 0.21 |
| Impact | 7 | 15 | 40 | 0.14 |
| Frequency | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0.21 |

**Computed Risk:** 55.41 (weighted: 8.31)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'Founding data scientist for the Enterprise Marketing Analytics team' and 'ground-up lead scoring model and implementation' - Shows ability to build new capabilities and solve complex problems independently
- **Impact:** Quote: 'Problem Solving' appears across multiple roles - This capability is important but can be developed, and candidate shows some evidence of it
- **Frequency:** Quote: 'Problem Solving' and 'Strategic Thinking' appear consistently, plus 'Founding data scientist' and 'ground-up' implementations - Shows pattern of tackling new challenges across multiple roles

---

### Full-Time Committed

**Weight:** 10%

**Definition:** Binary. In or out. No other startup, no consulting on the side. Available now and willing to work for equity.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 1 | 3 | 6 | 0.35 |
| Impact | 40 | 100 | 100 | 0.07 |
| Frequency | 6 | 10 | 10 | 0.28 |

**Computed Risk:** 6546.95 (weighted: 654.69)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: 'passively looking' and currently employed as 'Senior Manager, Data Science & Analytics' at AG1 plus 'Adjunct Assistant Professor' - Shows current employment and passive interest, unclear on full-time commitment
- **Impact:** No direct evidence found - Full-time commitment is binary and critical for startup success
- **Frequency:** Quote: 'passively looking' - No evidence of previous full-time startup commitment or equity-only work across career history

---

### Startup Experience

**Weight:** 5%

**Definition:** Nice to have. Not predictive. Has worked at an early-stage company or started something before.

| Dimension | Optimistic | Most Likely | Pessimistic | Confidence |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Probability | 3 | 6 | 10 | 0.28 |
| Impact | 1 | 3 | 7 | 0.14 |
| Frequency | 3 | 6 | 10 | 0.28 |

**Computed Risk:** 415.78 (weighted: 20.79)

**Reasoning:**

- **Probability:** Quote: Work history shows Boston Scientific, Greenlight, AG1, Kaplan Test Prep - All appear to be established companies, with Greenlight being the most startup-like (fintech). No clear early-stage startup experience
- **Impact:** No direct evidence found - Startup experience is noted as 'Nice to have. Not predictive' so impact is lower than other criteria
- **Frequency:** Quote: Greenlight experience (fintech) - Limited startup exposure, mostly established company experience across career

## Criteria Weighting Rationale

Trust & Communication is foundation - everything else fails without it. Shared Vision at equal weight because they need to understand Reckn is a decision engine, not a point solution. Sales capability matters but experience level is secondary. Scrappy beats credentials. Commitment is binary. Startup experience is nice but not predictive.
